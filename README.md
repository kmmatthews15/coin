# coin

## our idea 
Our application helps people visualize how to save and spend their money throughout the month. 
We came up with a graph template that will generate your monthly expenses once the forms are filled out.

## motivation 
Adulting is hard and budgeting apps are even harder. For us to effectively allow users to have an ease of use experience, 
at coin we've allowed for an easier, streamlined application. After filling in the prompts, 
we can generate a graph to visualize what needs to be saved and what can be spent.
